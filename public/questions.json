                "explanation": "First, 7/8 × (-2/7) = -2/8 = -1/4 (distributivity). Then, (-5/8) × 2/7 = -10/56 = -5/28. Now, -1/4 + (-5/28) = -7/28 - 5/28 = -12/28 = -3/7? Wait, error. Correct: Use additive inverse. Actually: Group as (7/8 × -2/7) + (-5/8 × 2/7) = (-2/8) + (-10/56). Simplify: -1/4 - 5/28 = -7/28 - 5/28 = -12/28 = -3/7. Wait, standard answer is -5/8? No. Let's recalculate: 7/8 * -2/7 = -14/56 = -1/4. -5/8 * 2/7 = -10/56 = -5/28. -1/4 = -7/28, -7/28 - 5/28 = -12/28 = -3/7. (Check textbook Ex 1.3 Q1: It's -3/7)."
